Project Overview

Cookie Cats is a highly popular mobile puzzle game created by Tactile Entertainment. The game follows the "connect three" puzzle format, where players link tiles of the same color to clear them from the board and advance to the next level. 

As players navigate through the game, they encounter gates that require them to either wait for a certain period or make an in-app purchase to continue. This project focuses on an A/B test conducted in Cookie Cats, where the location of the first gate was shifted from level 30 to level 40. Our goal is to analyze how this change affected player retention.
